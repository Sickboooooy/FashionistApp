        "1.  **How does the FashionistApp repository connect with e-commerce tools?**\n",
        "    Based on the analysis, the repository currently shows a foundational structure for e-commerce features (components for product display and search, database schema for products), but the integration with live e-commerce tools is not fully implemented. The client-side code uses mock data for product suggestions and search, and there is no direct evidence in the examined client code of external API calls being made to third-party e-commerce platforms. The actual connection is either incomplete, under development, or located in server-side code that was not accessible for examination.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **How does the AI generation work for the outfit or fashion prompt image maker?**\n",
        "    The AI generation process in FashionistApp appears to work by:\n",
        "    *   Initiating requests from the client-side (e.g., image uploads or text prompts) to a server-side endpoint (`/api/generate-outfits`).\n",
        "    *   The server-side processes these requests using AI models (documentation mentions Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT-4o for tasks like image analysis and content generation, respectively).\n",
        "    *   The AI generates outputs, which can include detailed text descriptions (likely prompts for image generation) and resulting image files (PNG, SVG).\n",
        "    *   These generated outputs are stored (e.g., in the `uploads` directory) and likely displayed to the user via client-side components. The process involves analyzing input (images/text), applying AI-powered styling, and generating fashion content/outfit suggestions or images.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The repository has a clear separation between client (`client`) and server (`server`) components, a shared module (`shared`), and a public assets directory (`public`).\n",
        "*   Documentation files (`README.md`, `attached_assets/*.txt`) explicitly mention the intention to integrate with e-commerce platforms like Amazon and use the Amazon Product Advertising API, as well as a \"Product Search\" feature involving external API integration.\n",
        "*   Client-side code for e-commerce features (`product-suggestions.tsx`, `product-search.tsx`) is present but currently uses `mockProducts` (simulated data) instead of calling live external APIs.\n",
        "*   Client-side components (`image-uploader.tsx`, `outfit-context.tsx`) initiate AI-driven outfit generation by making POST requests to a server endpoint (`/api/generate-outfits`).\n",
        "*   A client-side page (`ai-image-generator.tsx`) is dedicated to generating fashion images from text prompts.\n",
        "*   Documentation confirms the planned use of AI models like Google Gemini (for image analysis) and OpenAI GPT-4o (for content generation) within a \"Hybrid AI system.\"\n",
        "*   The `uploads` directory contains example files (`fashionai_gemini_..._description.txt`, `fashionai_gemini_....png`) that demonstrate the AI generation output, including detailed text prompts for image creation and the resulting image files.\n",
        "*   The database schema (`shared/schema.ts`) includes tables to support user data, preferences, uploaded garments, generated and saved outfits, and AI-generated designs (`selene_designs`).\n",
